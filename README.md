# g4d

This project's goal is to render 3D cross-sections of 4D geometry. There is code for the GPU-based pipeline, 
in addition to tools to generate 4D meshes and volume textures. No further development is planned for now. 

See [the demo](//github.com/tocubed/g4d-demo) which uses this code.

## Building
If you really want to use this library, you can build it using CMake. Remember to clone the submodules found in `deps/`.  
The code in this repository and [the demo](//github.com/tocubed/g4d-demo) is better used as a reference, 
as the design is still incomplete, and there are many yet unsolved challenges in 4D rendering engines.
